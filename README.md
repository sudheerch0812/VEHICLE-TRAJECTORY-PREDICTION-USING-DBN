# VEHICLE-TRAJECTORY-PREDICTION-USING-DBN

With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle trajectory prediction has
become a pivotal task in ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. Accurate
prediction of a vehicleâ€™s future path is essential for autonomous systems, as it enables proactive
decision-making, collision avoidance, and smoother integration into dynamic traffic. However,
predicting vehicle trajectories poses a significant challenge due to the inherently uncertain nature of
driving environments, where vehicles interact with numerous factors, including road conditions,
surrounding traffic, and driver intentions. Traditional trajectory prediction models, often deterministic,
fail to capture the diverse range of possible future states, especially in highly variable and interactive
settings like intersections, highways, and urban areas.
